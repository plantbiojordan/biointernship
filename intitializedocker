#HOW TO RUN A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK WITH PLANTCV ON THIS LAPTOP

cd ~
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "$PWD":/home/jordanmanchengo/data danforthcenter/plantcv

#You’ll see a line in terminal that says “to access the notebook, copy and paste one of these two links into your browser” one of them will work, and will open a Jupiter notebook for you. 

#Then you can create a new Jupiter python3 terminal, and start loading plantcv 

from plantcv import plantcv as pcv
print(pcv.__version__)

pcv.crop()
