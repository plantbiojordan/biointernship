# This is how I take an .mp4 time-lapse video and extract individual frames.

import os

while success:
    cv2.imwrite("/home/directory/to/frame%d.png" % count, image)

    print("Read a new frame: ", success)
    count +=1
    
# The result should look like this:

True
True
True
True
True
True
True
True
False

# "True" if a frame was read and captured, "False" when there are no more frames to be captured. 

# If nothing happens, no frames are being read. Make sure your video is an .mp4 and in the correct location!
